### CAUTION: For models with fixed effects, this code will yield the correct estimates
### of estimated marginal means -- but the wrong SEs because the intercept is among
### the fixed effects, hence not included in vcov(). CONTRASTS among EMMs will
### work fine because those give zero weight to the intercept.

### Another note: Only main model predictors are included in the reference grid.
### Not any fixed effects, not any instrumental variables

#' Support for emmeans package
#'
#' If \pkg{emmeans} is installed, its functionality is supported for \code{fixest}
#' or \code{fixest_multi} objects. Its reference grid is based on the main part
#' of the model, and does not include fixed effects or instrumental variables.
#' Note that any desired arguments to \code{vcov()} may be passed as optional
#' arguments in \code{emmeans::emmeans()} or \code{emmeans::ref_grid()}.
#'
#' @note
#' When fixed effects are present, estimated marginal means (EMMs) are estimated
#' correctly, provided equal weighting is used. However, the SEs of these EMMs
#' will be incorrect - often dramatically - because the estimated variance of
#' the intercept is not available. However, \emph{contrasts} among EMMs can be
#' estimated and tested with no issues, because these do not involve the
#' intercept.
