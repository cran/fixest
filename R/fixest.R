#' Fast and User-Friendly Fixed-Effects Estimations
#'
#' The package \pkg{fixest} provides a family of functions to perform estimations with multiple fixed-effects. Standard-errors can be easily and intuitively clustered. It also includes tools to seamlessly export the results of various estimations.
#'
#' @details
#' This package efficiently estimates models with multiple fixed-effect (i.e. multiple large factor variables).
#'
#' The core functions are: \code{\link[fixest]{feols}}, \code{\link[fixest]{feglm}} and \code{\link[fixest]{femlm}} to estimate, respectively, linear models, generalized linear models and maximum likelihood models with multiple fixed-effects. The function \code{\link[fixest]{feNmlm}} allows the inclusion of non-linear in parameters right hand sides. Finally \code{\link[fixest:feglm]{fepois}} and \code{\link[fixest:femlm]{fenegbin}} are shorthands to estimate Poisson and Negative Binomial models.
#'
#' Note that the functions \code{\link[fixest]{feglm}} and \code{\link[fixest]{femlm}} provide the same results when using the same families but differ in that the latter is a direct maximum likelihood optimization (so the two can really have different convergence rates).
#'
#' Several features are also included such as the possibility to easily compute different types of standard-errors (including multi-way clustering).
#'
#' It is possible to compare the results of several estimations by using the function \code{\link[fixest]{etable}}, which also allows to export them to Latex.
#'
#' You can plot the coefficients and confidence intervals of estimations easily with the function \code{\link[fixest]{coefplot}}. This function also offers a specific layout for interactions.
