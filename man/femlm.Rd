\arguments{
\item{fml}{A formula representing the relation to be estimated. For example: \code{fml = z~x+y}. To include fixed-effects, you can 1) either insert them in this formula using a pipe (e.g. \code{fml = z~x+y|cluster1+cluster2}), or 2) either use the argument \code{fixef}.}

\item{data}{A data.frame containing the necessary variables to run the model. The variables of the non-linear right hand side of the formula are identified with this \code{data.frame} names. Can also be a matrix.}

\item{family}{Character scalar. It should provide the family. The possible values are "poisson" (Poisson model with log-link, the default), "negbin" (Negative Binomial model with log-link), "logit" (LOGIT model with log-link), "gaussian" (Gaussian model).}

\item{start}{Starting values for the coefficients. Can be: i) a numeric of length 1 (e.g. \code{start = 0}, the default), ii) a numeric vector of the exact same length as the number of variables, or iii) a named vector of any length (the names will be used to initialize the appropriate coefficients).}

\item{fixef}{Character vector. The name/s of a/some variable/s within the dataset to be used as fixed-effects. These variables should contain the identifier of each observation (e.g., think of it as a panel identifier).}

\item{offset}{A formula or a numeric vector. An offset can be added to the estimation. If equal to a formula, it should be of the form (for example) \code{~0.5*x**2}. This offset is linearly added to the elements of the main formula 'fml'.}

\item{na_inf.rm}{Logical, default is \code{TRUE}. If the variables necessary for the estimation contain NA/Infs and \code{na_inf.rm = TRUE}, then all observations containing NA are removed prior to estimation and a note is displayed detailing the number of observations removed. Otherwise, an error is raised.}

\item{fixef.tol}{Precision used to obtain the fixed-effects (ie cluster coefficients). Defaults to \code{1e-5}. It corresponds to the maximum absolute difference allowed between two coefficients of successive iterations. Argument \code{fixef.tol} cannot be lower than \code{10000*.Machine$double.eps}. Note that this parameter is dynamically controlled by the algorithm.}

\item{fixef.iter}{Maximum number of iterations in the step obtaining the fixed-effects (only in use for 2+ clusters). Default is 10000.}

\item{nthreads}{Integer: Number of nthreads to be used (accelerates the algorithm via the use of openMP routines). The default is to use the total number of nthreads available minus two. You can set permanently the number of nthreads used within this package using the function \code{\link[fixest]{setFixest_nthreads}}.}

\item{verbose}{Integer, default is 0. It represents the level of information that should be reported during the optimisation process. If \code{verbose=0}: nothing is reported. If \code{verbose=1}: the value of the coefficients and the likelihood are reported. If \code{verbose=2}: \code{1} + information on the computing time of the null model, the cluster coefficients and the hessian are reported.}

\item{warn}{Logical, default is \code{TRUE}. Whether warnings should be displayed (concerns warnings relating to: convergence state, collinearity issues and observation removal due to only 0/1 outcomes or presence of NA values).}

\item{notes}{Logical. By default, two notes are displayed: when NAs are removed (to show additional information) and when some observations are removed because of only 0 (or 0/1) outcomes in a fixed-effect (in Poisson/Neg. Bin./Logit models). To avoid displaying these messages, you can set \code{notes = FALSE}. You can remove these messages permanently by using \code{setFixest_notes(FALSE)}.}

\item{theta.init}{Positive numeric scalar. The starting value of the dispersion parameter if \code{family="negbin"}. By default, the algorithm uses as a starting value the theta obtained from the model with only the intercept.}

\item{combine.quick}{Logical. When you combine different variables to transform them into a single fixed-effects you can do e.g. \code{y ~ x | paste(var1, var2)}. The algorithm provides a shorthand to do the same operation: \code{y ~ x | var1^var2}. Because pasting variables is a costly operation, the internal algorithm may use a numerical trick to hasten the process. The cost of doing so is that you lose the labels. If you are interested in getting the value of the fixed-effects coefficients after the estimation, you should use \code{combine.quick = FALSE}. By default it is equal to \code{FALSE} if the number of observations is lower than 50,000, and to \code{TRUE} otherwise.}

\description{
This function estimates maximum likelihood models with any number of fixed-effects.
}
\details{
This function estimates maximum likelihood models where the conditional expectations are as follows:

Gaussian likelihood:
\deqn{E(Y|X)=X\beta}{E(Y|X) = X*beta}
Poisson and Negative Binomial likelihoods:
\deqn{E(Y|X)=\exp(X\beta)}{E(Y|X) = exp(X*beta)}
where in the Negative Binomial there is the parameter \eqn{\theta}{theta} used to model the variance as \eqn{\mu+\mu^2/\theta}{mu+mu^2/theta}, with \eqn{\mu}{mu} the conditional expectation.
Logit likelihood:
\deqn{E(Y|X)=\frac{\exp(X\beta)}{1+\exp(X\beta)}}{E(Y|X) = exp(X*beta) / (1 + exp(X*beta))}

When there are one or more clusters, the conditional expectation can be written as:
\deqn{E(Y|X) = h(X\beta+\sum_{k}\sum_{m}\gamma_{m}^{k}\times C_{im}^{k}),}
where \eqn{h(.)} is the function corresponding to the likelihood function as shown before. \eqn{C^k} is the matrix associated to cluster \eqn{k} such that \eqn{C^k_{im}} is equal to 1 if observation \eqn{i} is of category \eqn{m} in cluster \eqn{k} and 0 otherwise.

When there are non linear in parameters functions, we can schematically split the set of regressors in two:
\deqn{f(X,\beta)=X^1\beta^1 + g(X^2,\beta^2)}
with first a linear term and then a non linear part expressed by the function g. That is, we add a non-linear term to the linear terms (which are \eqn{X*beta} and the cluster coefficients). It is always better (more efficient) to put into the argument \code{NL.fml} only the non-linear in parameter terms, and add all linear terms in the \code{fml} argument.

To estimate only a non-linear formula without even the intercept, you must exclude the intercept from the linear formula by using, e.g., \code{fml = z~0}.

The over-dispersion parameter of the Negative Binomial family, theta, is capped at 10,000. If theta reaches this high value, it means that there is no overdispersion.

\section{Combining the fixed-effects}{

You can combine two variables to make it a new fixed-effect using \code{^}. The syntax is as follows: \code{fe_1^fe_2}. Here you created a new variable which is the combination of the two variables fe_1 and fe_2. This is identical to doing \code{paste0(fe_1, "_", fe_2)} but more convenient.

Note that pasting is a costly operation, especially for large data sets. Thus, the internal algorithm uses a numerical trick which is fast, but the drawback is that the identity of each observation is lost (i.e. they are now equal to a meaningless number instead of being equal to \code{paste0(fe_1, "_", fe_2)}). These \dQuote{identities} are useful only if you're interested in the value of the fixed-effects (that you can extract with \code{\link[fixest]{fixef.fixest}}). If you're only interested in coefficients of the variables, it doesn't matter. Anyway, you can use \code{combine.quick = FALSE} to tell the internal algorithm to use \code{paste} instead of the numerical trick. By default, the numerical trick is performed only for large data sets.
