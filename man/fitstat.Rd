\title{Computes fit statistics of fixest objects}
\usage{
fitstat(
  x,
  type,
  vcov = NULL,
  cluster = NULL,
  ssc = NULL,
  simplify = FALSE,
  verbose = TRUE,
  show_types = FALSE,
  frame = parent.frame(),
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A \code{fixest} estimation.}

\item{type}{Character vector or one sided formula. The type of fit statistic to be computed.
The classic ones are: n, rmse, r2, pr2, f, wald, ivf, ivwald. You have the full list in
the details section or use \code{show_types = TRUE}. Further, you can register your own types
with \code{\link{fitstat_register}}.}

\item{vcov}{Versatile argument to specify the VCOV. In general, it is either a character
scalar equal to a VCOV type, either a formula of the form: \code{vcov_type ~ variables}. The
VCOV types implemented are: "iid", "hetero" (or "HC1"), "cluster", "twoway",
"NW" (or "newey_west"), "DK" (or "driscoll_kraay"), and "conley". It also accepts
object from \code{\link{vcov_cluster}}, \code{\link[=vcov_hac]{vcov_NW}}, \code{\link[=vcov_hac]{NW}},
\code{\link[=vcov_hac]{vcov_DK}}, \code{\link[=vcov_hac]{DK}}, \code{\link{vcov_conley}} and
\code{\link[=vcov_conley]{conley}}. It also accepts covariance matrices computed externally.
Finally it accepts functions to compute the covariances. See the \code{vcov} documentation
in the \href{https://lrberge.github.io/fixest/articles/fixest_walkthrough.html#the-vcov-argument-1}{vignette}.}

\item{cluster}{Tells how to cluster the standard-errors (if clustering is requested).
Can be either a list of vectors, a character vector of variable names, a formula or
an integer vector. Assume we want to perform 2-way clustering over \code{var1} and \code{var2}
contained in the data.frame \code{base} used for the estimation. All the following
\code{cluster} arguments are valid and do the same thing:
\code{cluster = base[, c("var1", "var2")]}, \code{cluster = c("var1", "var2")}, \code{cluster = ~var1+var2}.
If the two variables were used as fixed-effects in the estimation, you can leave it
blank with \code{vcov = "twoway"} (assuming \code{var1} [resp. \code{var2}] was
the 1st [resp. 2nd] fixed-effect). You can interact two variables using \code{^} with
the following syntax: \code{cluster = ~var1^var2} or \code{cluster = "var1^var2"}.}

\item{ssc}{An object of class \code{ssc.type} obtained with the function \code{\link{ssc}}. Represents
how the degree of freedom correction should be done.You must use the function \code{\link{ssc}}
for this argument. The arguments and defaults of the function \code{\link{ssc}} are:
\code{K.adj = TRUE}, \code{K.fixef = "nonnested"}, \code{G.adj = TRUE}, \code{G.df = "min"},
\code{t.df = "min"}, \verb{K.exact = FALSE)}. See the help of the function \code{\link{ssc}} for details.}

\item{simplify}{Logical, default is \code{FALSE}. By default a list is returned whose names are
the selected types. If \code{simplify = TRUE} and only one type is selected, then the element
is directly returned (ie will not be nested in a list).}

\item{verbose}{Logical, default is \code{TRUE}. If \code{TRUE}, an object of class \code{fixest_fitstat}
is returned (so its associated print method will be triggered). If \code{FALSE} a simple list
is returned instead.}

\item{show_types}{Logical, default is \code{FALSE}. If \code{TRUE}, only prompts all available types.}

\item{frame}{An environment in which to evaluate variables, default is \code{parent.frame()}.
Only used if the argument \code{type} is a formula and some values in the formula have to be
extended with the dot square bracket operator. Mostly for internal use.}

\item{...}{For internal use.}
}
\value{
By default an object of class \code{fixest_fitstat} is returned. Using \code{verbose = FALSE}
returns a simple a list. Finally, if only one type is selected, \code{simplify = TRUE}
leads to the selected type to be returned.

\section{Registering your own types}{


You can register custom fit statistics with the function \code{fitstat_register}.
}

\section{Available types}{


The types are case sensitive, please use lower case only. The types available are:

\describe{
\item{\code{n}, \code{ll}, \code{aic}, \code{bic}, \code{rmse}: }{The number of observations, the log-likelihood,
the AIC, the BIC and the root mean squared error, respectively.}
\item{\code{my}: }{Mean of the dependent variable.}
\item{\code{g}: }{The degrees of freedom used to compute the t-test (it influences the p-values
of the coefficients). When the VCOV is clustered, this value is equal to the minimum
cluster size, otherwise, it is equal to the sample size minus the number of variables.}
\item{\code{r2}, \code{ar2}, \code{wr2}, \code{awr2}, \code{pr2}, \code{apr2}, \code{wpr2}, \code{awpr2}: }{All r2 that can be
obtained with the function \code{\link{r2}}. The \code{a} stands for 'adjusted', the \code{w} for 'within' and
the \code{p} for 'pseudo'. Note that the order of the letters \code{a}, \code{w} and \code{p} does not matter.
The pseudo R2s are McFadden's R2s (ratios of log-likelihoods).}
\item{\code{theta}: }{The over-dispersion parameter in Negative Binomial models. Low values mean
high overdispersion.}
\item{\code{f}, \code{wf}: }{The F-tests of nullity of the coefficients. The \code{w} stands for
'within'. These types return the following values: \code{stat}, \code{p}, \code{df1} and \code{df2}.
If you want to display only one of these, use their name after a dot: e.g. \code{f.stat}
will give the statistic of the F-test, or \code{wf.p} will give the p-values of the F-test
on the projected model (i.e. projected onto the fixed-effects).}
\item{\code{wald}: }{Wald test of joint nullity of the coefficients. This test always excludes
the intercept and the fixed-effects. These type returns the following values:
\code{stat}, \code{p}, \code{df1}, \code{df2} and \code{vcov}. The element \code{vcov} reports the way the VCOV
matrix was computed since it directly influences this statistic.}
\item{\code{ivf}, \code{ivf1}, \code{ivf2}, \code{ivfall}: }{These statistics are specific to IV estimations.
They report either the IV F-test (namely the Cragg-Donald F statistic in the presence
of only one endogenous regressor) of the first stage (\code{ivf} or \code{ivf1}), of the
second stage (\code{ivf2}) or of both (\code{ivfall}). The F-test of the first stage is
commonly named weak instrument test. The value of \code{ivfall} is only useful in \code{\link{etable}}
when both the 1st and 2nd stages are displayed (it leads to the 1st stage F-test(s)
to be displayed on the 1st stage estimation(s), and the 2nd stage one on the
2nd stage estimation -- otherwise, \code{ivf1} would also be displayed on the 2nd stage
estimation). These types return the following values: \code{stat}, \code{p}, \code{df1} and \code{df2}.}
\item{\code{ivwald}, \code{ivwald1}, \code{ivwald2}, \code{ivwaldall}: }{These statistics are specific to IV
estimations. They report either the IV Wald-test of the first stage (\code{ivwald} or \code{ivwald1}),
of the second stage (\code{ivwald2}) or of both (\code{ivwaldall}). The Wald-test of the first stage
is commonly named weak instrument test. Note that if the estimation was done with a robust
VCOV and there is only one endogenous regressor, this is equivalent to the
Kleibergen-Paap statistic. The value of \code{ivwaldall} is only useful in \code{\link{etable}} when both
the 1st and 2nd stages are displayed (it leads to the 1st stage Wald-test(s) to be displayed
on the 1st stage estimation(s), and the 2nd stage one on the 2nd stage estimation --
otherwise, \code{ivwald1} would also be displayed on the 2nd stage estimation). These types
return the following values: \code{stat}, \code{p}, \code{df1}, \code{df2}, and \code{vcov}.}
\item{\code{cd}: }{The Cragg-Donald test for weak instruments.}
\item{\code{kpr}: }{The Kleibergen-Paap test for weak instruments.}
\item{\code{wh}: }{This statistic is specific to IV estimations. Wu-Hausman endogeneity test.
H0 is the absence of endogeneity of the instrumented variables. It returns the following
values: \code{stat}, \code{p}, \code{df1}, \code{df2}.}
\item{\code{sargan}: }{Sargan test of overidentifying restrictions. H0: the instruments are
not correlated with the second stage residuals. It returns the
following values: \code{stat}, \code{p}, \code{df}.}
\item{\code{lr}, \code{wlr}: }{Likelihood ratio and within likelihood ratio tests. It returns
the following elements: \code{stat}, \code{p}, \code{df}. Concerning the within-LR test, note that,
contrary to estimations with \code{femlm} or \code{feNmlm}, estimations with \code{feglm}/\code{fepois}
need to estimate the model with fixed-effects only which may prove time-consuming
(depending on your model). Bottom line, if you really need the within-LR and estimate a
Poisson model, use \code{femlm} instead of \code{fepois} (the former uses direct ML maximization for
which the only FEs model is a by product).}

\examples{

data(trade)
gravity = feols(log(Euros) ~ log(dist_km) | Destination + Origin, trade)

# Extracting the 'working' number of observations used to compute the pvalues
fitstat(gravity, "g", simplify = TRUE)

# Some fit statistics
fitstat(gravity, ~ rmse + r2 + wald + wf)

# You can use them in etable
etable(gravity, fitstat = ~ rmse + r2 + wald + wf)

# For wald and wf, you could show the pvalue instead:
etable(gravity, fitstat = ~ rmse + r2 + wald.p + wf.p)

# Now let's display some statistics that are not built-in
# => we use fitstat_register to create them

# We need: a) type name, b) the function to be applied
#          c) (optional) an alias

fitstat_register("tstand", function(x) tstat(x, se = "stand")[1], "t-stat (regular)")
fitstat_register("thc", function(x) tstat(x, se = "heter")[1], "t-stat (HC1)")
fitstat_register("t1w", function(x) tstat(x, se = "clus")[1], "t-stat (clustered)")
fitstat_register("t2w", function(x) tstat(x, se = "twow")[1], "t-stat (2-way)")

# Now we can use these keywords in fitstat:
etable(gravity, fitstat = ~ . + tstand + thc + t1w + t2w)

# Note that the custom stats we created are can easily lead
# to errors, but that's another story!
