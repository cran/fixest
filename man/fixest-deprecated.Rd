From \code{fixest} version 0.3.0 onwards, estimating yearly effects with a simple interaction of the type \code{var::year(ref)} in the formula is preferred (see details in \code{\link[fixest]{feols}}). You can then plot the yearly treatment with the function \code{\link[fixest]{coefplot}}. You have examples detailed in \code{\link[fixest]{coefplot}}.
